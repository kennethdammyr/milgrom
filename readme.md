This project is intented to process professional video uploaded to an Azure Blob Storage.

Initially we will:
- Index all files in a database
- Catalog the files in their respective memory cards (XQD, SxS, GoPro etc.)
- Transcode to a proxy format

Further, we will present the database in a user friendly interface where the user will be given options like:
- Preview media
- Perform cognitive services on the media
- Prepare for video editing
